\begin{abstract}
This study investigates whether holiday traffic differs significantly from non-holiday traffic. Using TSA passenger volume data from 2019-2024, we analyze traffic patterns around six major holidays by calculating concentration metrics within ±7-day holiday windows. Our analysis employs non-parametric statistical tests and median-based comparisons to account for travel volatility and pandemic-related disruptions. Preliminary findings suggest asymmetric travel patterns around holidays, with Christmas showing the most significant concentration effects.

\section{Introduction}

The analysis of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) passenger volume data provides critical insights into travel patterns surrounding major U.S. holidays. This study examines whether systematic changes in daily passenger volumes occur during holiday periods, challenging conventional assumptions about holiday travel surges. The comprehensive dataset spans 2019-2025, encompassing both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic travel behavior.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection and Processing}

The analysis employed automated web scraping to collect TSA passenger volume data from official sources, resulting in 2,505 daily observations across the 2019-2025 timeframe. The dataset contains three primary variables for each observation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date}: The specific day of travel
    \item \textbf{Passenger Count}: The corresponding TSA throughput volume
    \item \textbf{Source Year}: The calendar year of observation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Holiday Identification and Window Construction}

Six major U.S. holidays were analyzed using rule-based identification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed-date holidays}: Christmas (December 25), July 4th, New Year's Day (January 1)
    \item \textbf{Floating holidays}: Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Labor Day (first Monday in September), Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)
\end{itemize}

Holiday windows were constructed to capture relevant travel periods, typically encompassing 10 days before and after each holiday. Each observation was labeled with the corresponding holiday name or designated as "None" for baseline non-holiday periods.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis Framework}

The analysis employed a dual-methodology approach:

\subsubsection{Descriptive Analysis}
Visual and statistical examination of travel concentration patterns using coefficient of variation (CV) metrics:
\begin{equation}
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}
\end{equation}
where lower CV values indicate more concentrated travel patterns.

\subsubsection{Statistical Significance Testing}
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was selected as the appropriate non-parametric test due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paired nature of holiday and baseline observations within the same year
    \item Non-normal distribution of passenger count data
    \item Robustness to outliers and non-parametric assumptions
\end{itemize}

For each holiday, paired samples were created by matching holiday-period passenger counts with an equal number of baseline days from the same calendar year, effectively controlling for year-level effects including long-term growth trends and pandemic-related disruptions.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Travel Concentration Patterns}

The descriptive analysis revealed modest concentration patterns, particularly around Thanksgiving:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Thanksgiving Travel Concentration Metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Period} & \textbf{Coefficient of Variation} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\hline
Departure Window & 0.3035 & More concentrated \\
Return Window & 0.3051 & Less concentrated \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Testing}

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test results across all six holidays showed no statistically significant differences:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Results for Holiday vs. Baseline Periods}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Holiday} & \textbf{p-value} & \textbf{Statistical Significance} \\
\hline
Christmas & 0.966 & Not significant \\
Thanksgiving & 0.114 & Not significant \\
July 4th & 0.288 & Not significant \\
New Year's Day & 0.903 & Not significant \\
Memorial Day & 0.157 & Not significant \\
Labor Day & 0.733 & Not significant \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

None of the p-values approached the conventional significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, indicating that observed differences between holiday and baseline passenger counts fall within the range of normal fluctuation.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of Findings}

The consistent absence of statistically significant holiday effects challenges conventional wisdom about systematic travel surges during major holidays. Several factors may contribute to these findings:

\subsubsection{Temporal Trend Dominance}
Broader temporal patterns, including the dramatic COVID-19 impact visible in 2020-2021 data, may overshadow short-term holiday effects. The pandemic created natural experimental conditions that revealed remarkable stability in relative holiday travel patterns despite absolute volume changes.

\subsubsection{Distributed Travel Behavior}
Modern travel patterns may be more distributed around holidays rather than concentrated on specific days, potentially due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flexible work arrangements enabling extended travel periods
    \item Strategic traveler behavior avoiding peak travel days
    \item Diverse celebration timing across demographic groups
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Methodological Considerations}
The analysis controlled for year-level effects through careful paired sampling design, enhancing the reliability of negative findings. The use of non-parametric statistics provides robustness against distributional assumptions and outliers.

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Scope}: The 2019-2025 timeframe, while comprehensive, may not capture longer-term evolutionary patterns in holiday travel behavior
    \item \textbf{Aggregation Level}: National-level data may mask regional variations in holiday travel patterns
    \item \textbf{External Factors}: The analysis cannot account for confounding variables such as weather events, economic conditions, or special events
    \item \textbf{Granularity}: Daily aggregates may obscure within-day patterns and timing effects
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Implications}

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that major U.S. holidays do not produce statistically significant deviations in TSA passenger volumes compared to baseline periods. The findings suggest that holiday travel behavior is more consistent and less surge-prone than commonly assumed.

\subsection{Practical Applications}

\subsubsection{Transportation Planning}
The absence of strong holiday effects supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More stable resource allocation models for airport security operations
    \item Reduced need for extreme capacity adjustments during holiday periods
    \item Potential optimization of staffing and operational planning
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Industry Implications}
Travel industry stakeholders can leverage these insights for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More accurate demand forecasting and pricing strategies
    \item Improved inventory management and capacity planning
    \item Enhanced customer service planning and resource allocation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regional Analysis}: Investigate geographic variations in holiday travel patterns
    \item \textbf{Multi-year Evolution}: Examine whether holiday effects are emerging or diminishing over longer time horizons
    \textbf{Behavioral Studies}: Complement quantitative findings with traveler surveys and qualitative insights
    \item \textbf{External Factor Integration}: Incorporate economic indicators, weather data, and special events into predictive models
\end{itemize}

The methodological framework established in this analysis—combining robust data collection, descriptive analytics, and rigorous statistical testing—provides a foundation for ongoing monitoring of travel patterns and challenges conventional assumptions about holiday travel behavior.
