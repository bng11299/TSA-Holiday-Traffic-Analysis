\begin{abstract}
This study asks whether air travel around major U.S.\ holidays differs from non-holiday days and whether departure traffic is more concentrated than return traffic. Using TSA checkpoint passenger volume data from 2019--2024, we build symmetric $\pm 7$-day windows around six major holidays and summarize travel using median passenger volumes and coefficient of variation (CV) metrics. To compare holiday periods to baseline days, we form paired daily samples of holiday-window and non-holiday passenger counts within each year and apply Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Our descriptive results show modest and asymmetric travel patterns around holidays. However, in this testing framework none of the six holidays show statistically significant differences between holiday-window and non-holiday daily counts at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level. Overall, holiday travel effects are weaker and less universal than common intuition suggests, with the clearest concentration patterns appearing around Thanksgiving.

\section{Introduction}

Airports are often thought to be much busier around major holidays, with crowded departure days before the holiday and heavy return traffic afterward. These beliefs affect how travelers plan trips and how agencies like TSA plan staffing at checkpoints.

In this project, we use Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint passenger volume data to study travel patterns around major U.S.\ holidays. We focus on two questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Are daily passenger counts in the days around major holidays different from daily counts on non-holiday days?
    \item Is departure traffic (pre-holiday days) more concentrated than return traffic (post-holiday days)?
\end{enumerate}

We look at six holidays that usually matter for travel: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day (July 4th), Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. For each holiday, we analyze daily TSA throughput in a $\pm 7$-day window from 2019 through 2024. This covers pre-pandemic travel levels, the collapse in 2020, and the rebound and growth in later years.

We first describe travel patterns using CVs and medians. Then we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on paired daily holiday vs.\ non-holiday counts to see whether holiday windows differ from baseline days in a statistically meaningful way.

\section{Data Collection and Processing}

\subsection{Data Source and Scraping}

We collect daily TSA checkpoint passenger volumes from official TSA web pages using Python's \texttt{requests} and \texttt{BeautifulSoup} libraries. For each year page, we scrape HTML tables listing the date and corresponding passenger throughput. From each row we extract:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date}: calendar date of the observation
    \item \textbf{Passenger Count}: number of passengers screened at TSA checkpoints
    \item \textbf{Source Year}: the year associated with the TSA page
\end{itemize}

Our scraping code targets all available pages from 2019 through 2025. The 2025 page is included in the pipeline so that the code continues working as new data are added. For this analysis, we restrict the data to 2019--2024 and drop 2025 because the year is incomplete.

\subsection{Cleaning and Date Alignment}

We convert the date strings to \texttt{datetime} objects and sort the rows by date. To check that the series is complete, we build a full sequence of calendar dates from the first to the last observation and align the data to this sequence using \texttt{reindex}. Our cleaning code is able to forward-fill and backward-fill passenger counts for any missing dates, which would keep the time series continuous.

In practice, the TSA daily series for 2019--2024 appears complete, so very little or no imputation is actually needed. We remove any duplicate dates and, when needed, reconstruct the \texttt{source\_year} from the calendar year of the date. The cleaned dataset has one row per day with date, passenger count, year, month, and weekday.

\section{Holiday Identification and Window Construction}

\subsection{Rule-Based Holiday Tagging}

We study six holidays using simple calendar rules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed-date holidays}: New Year's Day (January 1), Independence Day (July 4), Christmas (December 25).
    \item \textbf{Floating holidays}: Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Labor Day (first Monday in September), Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November).
\end{itemize}

For each date, we compute its year, month, day, and weekday (Monday=0,\dots,Sunday=6) and apply these rules to assign a holiday label (\texttt{holiday\_name}). Dates that are not holidays are labeled as \texttt{None} and treated as non-holiday baseline days.

\subsection{Holiday Windows and Departure vs.\ Return Periods}

For each holiday \(H\) and year \(y\) from 2019--2024, we build a window centered on the holiday date. The window includes seven days before and seven days after, giving 15 days with offsets \(-7, -6, \dots, 0, \dots, +6, +7\), where day 0 is the holiday itself.

Within each holiday window we define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Departure window}: days \(-7\) through \(0\). These represent pre-holiday and same-day departures.
    \item \textbf{Return window}: days \(+1\) through \(+7\). These represent post-holiday returns.
\end{itemize}

For every holiday, year, and day offset, we match the corresponding daily passenger count. This allows us to plot how travel behaves around the holiday and compare departure and return patterns across years.

\section{Statistical Analysis}

\subsection{Descriptive Metrics}

\subsubsection{Coefficient of Variation}

For each holiday \(H\) and year \(y\), we compute the coefficient of variation (CV) for both the departure and return windows:
\begin{equation}
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu},
\end{equation}
where \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of daily passenger counts in the window and \(\mu\) is the mean. A lower CV means the daily values are more similar to each other, which indicates more concentration.

We also compute pooled CVs across all years for each holiday and window. For Thanksgiving, these pooled CVs are shown in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\subsubsection{Medians and Percent Change}

To compare holiday windows to typical non-holiday days, we use medians rather than means so that extreme spikes do not dominate the averages. For each holiday \(H\) and year \(y\), we compute:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the median daily passenger count in the \(\pm 7\)-day window, and
    \item the median daily passenger count on all non-holiday days within the same overall period.
\end{itemize}

We also compute percent change between median holiday-window counts and the overall non-holiday median for descriptive plots. These summaries are used to show which holidays tend to have higher typical traffic than non-holiday days.

\subsection{Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test on Daily Values}

To formally test whether holiday-period counts differ from non-holiday counts, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with paired daily values.

For each holiday (e.g., Christmas), we do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Within each year, we collect all daily passenger counts in the holiday window that are labeled with that holiday.
    \item Within the same year, we collect daily passenger counts for non-holiday days labeled \texttt{None}.
    \item We let \(n\) be the smaller of the two counts and keep the first \(n\) days from each group in that year (using the original date order).
    \item We stack these paired daily values across all years to form two samples of equal length: one sample of holiday-period daily counts and one sample of baseline daily counts.
\end{enumerate}

We then apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to these paired daily values for each holiday. This test is suitable because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It compares paired observations (holiday vs.\ baseline) without assuming normality.
    \item TSA passenger counts are skewed and can have large outliers, so a rank-based non-parametric test is more robust than a simple paired t-test.
\end{itemize}

We use the conventional significance level \(\alpha = 0.05\). If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that the holiday period differs systematically from the baseline. Otherwise, we treat any differences as within the range of normal variation.

\subsection{Levene's Test for Departure vs.\ Return Concentration}

To address our second research question---whether departure traffic (pre-holiday days) is more concentrated than return traffic (post-holiday days)---we apply Levene's test for equality of variances. Because concentration corresponds to lower variability, this test directly evaluates whether the variance of pre-holiday passenger counts differs from that of post-holiday counts.

For each holiday, we construct two samples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-holiday sample}: daily passenger counts from days $-7$ through $0$ relative to the holiday.
    \item \textbf{Post-holiday sample}: daily passenger counts from days $+1$ through $+7$.
\end{itemize}

Levene's test evaluates
\[
H_0: \sigma_{\text{pre}}^2 = \sigma_{\text{post}}^2
\qquad\text{vs.}\qquad
H_A: \sigma_{\text{pre}}^2 \neq \sigma_{\text{post}}^2,
\]
with significance level $\alpha = 0.05$. Because TSA passenger counts are highly seasonal, skewed, and often exhibit extreme outliers, a variance-comparison test that does not assume normality is appropriate here.

Across all six holidays, the Levene statistics are small and the p-values well exceed $0.05$, indicating no evidence that the two variances differ. Table~\ref{tab:levene} summarizes these results.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Travel Concentration Patterns}

Plots aligned by days from each holiday show clear seasonal patterns and different shapes for each holiday. Thanksgiving has a strong departure wave in the days before the holiday and a visible return wave afterwards. Christmas travel is more spread out, and summer holidays show smaller bumps on top of an already busy summer baseline.

To look directly at concentration for Thanksgiving, we compute pooled CVs across all years for departures and returns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small % or \footnotesize
\caption{Thanksgiving Travel Concentration Metrics (2019--2024)}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Period} & \textbf{Coefficient of Variation} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
Departure Window & 0.3035 & More concentrated \\
Return Window    & 0.3051 & Less concentrated \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The difference is small, but it supports the idea that departures are slightly more tightly packed into a narrow set of days, while returns are spread out a bit more.

For the other holidays, departure and return CVs are closer together and show weaker asymmetry.

\subsection{Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Results}

We next look at the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results for each holiday. Table~\ref{tab:wilcoxon} shows the p-values and whether the results are statistically significant at \(\alpha = 0.05\).

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Results for Holiday vs.\ Baseline Periods}
\label{tab:wilcoxon}
\begin{tabular}{l S[table-format=3.0] S[table-format=1.3] l}
\toprule
\textbf{Holiday} & 
\textbf{Wilcoxon Statistic} & 
\textbf{p-value} & 
\textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
Christmas       & 84  & 0.966 & Not significant \\
Thanksgiving    & 173 & 0.114 & Not significant \\
July 4th        & 84  & 0.288 & Not significant \\
New Year's Day  & 50  & 0.903 & Not significant \\
Memorial Day    & 74  & 0.157 & Not significant \\
Labor Day       & 105 & 0.733 & Not significant \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


In this testing setup, none of the holidays show p-values below 0.05. Even though some holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas, look busier in the plots and have higher medians, the Wilcoxon test suggests that these differences are not large enough, or not consistent enough, to be statistically significant given the way we formed the paired samples.

\subsection{Interpretation of the Levene Results}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Levene's Test Results for Pre-Holiday vs.\ Post-Holiday Variances}
\label{tab:levene}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Holiday} & \textbf{Levene Stat.} & \textbf{p-value} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
Christmas      & 0.0005 & 0.983 & No variance diff \\
Thanksgiving   & 1.6592 & 0.199 & No variance diff \\
July~4th       & 0.0520 & 0.820 & No variance diff \\
New~Year's     & 0.6489 & 0.423 & No variance diff \\
Memorial~Day   & 0.2392 & 0.626 & No variance diff \\
Labor~Day      & 1.0764 & 0.302 & No variance diff \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Levene test results indicate that, for every holiday studied, the variability of passenger volumes in the departure window is statistically indistinguishable from the variability in the return window. Although the raw variances differ numerically for some holidays (e.g., Thanksgiving shows higher post-holiday variance than pre-holiday variance), these differences are far from statistically significant.

This means that, in the national TSA dataset, there is no detectable asymmetry in how tightly packed departure versus return days are around holidays. Even holidays with well-known travel patterns such as Thanksgiving show no significant variance difference once we aggregate across all U.S.\ airports and all years from 2019--2024.

In short, while descriptive plots and CV summaries suggest that departure traffic may appear slightly more concentrated for certain holidays, particularly Thanksgiving, the formal variance comparison finds no statistically supported difference between pre-holiday and post-holiday volatility. Any departure–return asymmetry is either too small or too inconsistent across years to be detected in the national aggregate.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of Findings}

Our results suggest that the simple story of ``huge holiday spikes'' is too strong at the national level, at least in this dataset and testing framework.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas do show clear patterns and often higher daily counts than typical days in the same season, especially in the descriptive plots and medians.
    \item However, once we compare paired daily values of holiday-window and non-holiday counts using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, none of the holidays show statistically significant differences at \(\alpha = 0.05\).
    \item Summer holidays take place during a busy travel season, so their extra effect on top of the baseline is modest.
\end{itemize}

The CV comparison for Thanksgiving supports the idea that departures are slightly more concentrated than returns. For other holidays, the difference between departure and return concentration is less clear.

\subsection{Limitations}

There are several limitations to this analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time period}: The years 2019--2024 include the COVID-19 shock and recovery, which may not represent typical long-run patterns.
    \item \textbf{Pairing method}: In the Wilcoxon test, baseline days are chosen within each year and paired by simple order (\texttt{head(n)}). We do not match by weekday or month in this older test design, which might reduce sensitivity.
    \item \textbf{Aggregation}: TSA counts are national totals and may hide strong regional differences.
    \item \textbf{Possible imputation}: The cleaning pipeline can fill missing dates, but the raw TSA series appears nearly complete, so any filled values are likely rare.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Future Research Directions}

There are several natural extensions of this work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regional analysis}: Investigate geographic differences in holiday travel patterns, for example by comparing large hubs, regional airports, and different U.S.\ regions.
    \item \textbf{Multi-year evolution}: Examine whether holiday effects are emerging or shrinking over longer time horizons, beyond 2019--2024.
    \item \textbf{Behavioral studies}: Complement aggregate TSA data with traveler surveys or qualitative interviews to understand how people choose departure and return days.
    \item \textbf{External factor integration}: Incorporate economic indicators, weather events, and special events (e.g., major sports or political events) into models of daily passenger volume.
\end{itemize}

The basic framework in this analysis---automated data collection, descriptive time-window analytics, and non-parametric testing of holiday effects---can be reused and extended to monitor travel patterns over time and to test more detailed hypotheses about holiday travel behavior.

\section{Conclusion and Implications}

Using TSA checkpoint data from 2019--2024, we studied how air travel behaves around major U.S.\ holidays. We looked at both concentration patterns and statistical differences between holiday windows and non-holiday days.

Our main takeaways are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Descriptively, holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas show higher volumes and clear shapes in the days before and after the holiday.
    \item In the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on paired daily values, none of the six holidays show statistically significant differences between holiday-window and non-holiday counts at the 0.05 level.
    \item Thanksgiving departures appear slightly more concentrated than returns, but this pattern is small and mainly descriptive.
\end{itemize}

For TSA and airport planners, these results suggest that some holidays, especially Thanksgiving, deserve attention due to their clear patterns, but that national total volumes do not always show large, statistically strong deviations from non-holiday days. Local or airport-specific analyses might show stronger effects than the national aggregate.
